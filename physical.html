<h2>What are the mental health benefits of exercise?</h2>
<span>Exercise is not just about aerobic capacity and muscle size. 
Sure, exercise can improve your physical health and your physique, 
and even add years to your life. </span>
<br>
<span>But exercise is also one of the most effective ways to improve your mental health. 
Regular exercise can have a profoundly positive impact on depression, anxiety, ADHD, 
and more. It also relieves stress, improves memory, helps you sleep better, and boosts overall mood.
 And it's also powerful medicine for many common mental health challenges.</span>

<h3 style="color:black">Exercise and depression</h3>
<span>Studies show that exercise can treat mild to moderate depression as effectively as antidepressant medication but without the side-effects, of course. In addition to relieving depression symptoms, research also shows that maintaining an exercise schedule can prevent you from relapsing.
Exercise is a powerful depression fighter for several reasons. Most importantly, it promotes all kinds of changes in the brain, including neural growth, reduced inflammation, and new activity patterns that promote feelings of calm and well-being. It also releases endorphins, powerful chemicals in your brain that energize your spirits and make you feel good. Finally, exercise can also serve as a distraction, allowing you to find some quiet time to break out of the cycle of negative thoughts that feed depression.

When it comes to workouts that fight depression, aerobic and cardio exercises have the edge. To date, the strongest evidence seems to support aerobic exercise,says Dr. Muzina. While the correct "dose" of depression-fighting exercise is up for debate, some experts recommend 20 to 30 minutes most days of the week. A recent review of numerous scientific studies found no association between the intensity level of the exercise and its emotional benefit  so simply moving more is a great start.

Ever heard of runners high? The most tangible example of exercise stimulating certain brain chemicals is the runner's high that many athletes report experiencing once crossing a certain threshold of exertion while running, explains Muzina. That euphoria is due to the release of endorphins in the brain in response to the sustained physical activity.

Endorphins are our body's natural morphine and, when released by special glands in our brains, they can produce a sense of well-being or joy and also decrease pain levels.

<h3>Hiking</h3>
<span>
Getting away from people and out in nature may be exactly what you need to feel happy and healthy, because nature, as it turns out, is a powerful antidepressant,

If you take a walk in a natural environment for about fifty minutes you can improve your mood, reduce your anxiety and improve your memory. With this being around the same amount of time that you put into working out at a gym, this could be a great substitute that not only helps your physical state, but also mental.

So, how exactly does nature help? It is believed that hiking? around trees and plants, especially the decaying ones, can reduce the levels of anxiety. Plants emit chemicals that slow down their decaying process. These chemicals have proven to slow down individuals too, leading to less anxiety.

Simply putting one foot in front of the other may be the trick to feeling better  that's because walking is an aerobic exercise that's suited for almost everyone. All it takes is a pair of comfortable, supportive shoes, and you are ready to go.

Practical wisdom suggests that doing something is better than doing nothing in terms of physical activity, says Muzina. If depression has made you sedentary, start off slowly and gradually increase time and distance.
yoga 
Ohm  in a study of 65 women with depression and anxiety, the 34 women who took a yoga class twice a week for two months showed a significant decrease in depression and anxiety symptoms, compared to the 31 women who were not in the class.

Eastern traditions such as yoga have a wonderful antidepressant effect in that they improve flexibility; involve mindfulness, which breaks up repetitive negative thoughts; increase strength; make you aware of your breathing; improve balance; and contain a meditative component, says Norman E. Rosenthal, MD, a clinical professor of psychiatry at the Georgetown University School of Medicine in Washington, D.C.

Dr. Rosenthal suggests starting with a yoga class in your area so you can be sure that you are doing the movements and poses properly.

<h3>Dancing</h3>
<span>
Dance and movement therapy are consisted of music, easy exercises and sensorial stimulus and provide drugless treatment for the depression on low rates.

Dance improves your heart health, overall muscle strength, balance and coordination, and reduces depression. ... Teens aren't the only ones who can dance their way to mental health. Senior adults (and adults of all ages) can reap the benefits too


Additionally, whilst the physical movement of dance helps reduce stress, anxiety and depression, dancing with others also helps us feel more connected and social. Dance classes can encourage social bonds and friendships which are key factors in improving our mood and mental health.

Could a trip to the gym be just what the therapist ordered?

Exercise certainly isn't a depression cure-all, but a study published in the Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology found that heart-pumping, endorphin-boosting workouts actually promote happiness.

Researchers say that more physically active people reported greater general feelings of excitement and enthusiasm than less-active people. And beyond its protective effect against feelings of depression, exercise may reduce stress and help you secure a better nights sleep. That's why your favorite fitness routine can be an excellent addition to your depression treatment plan.

Exercise stimulates the release of many of the brain chemicals thought to be in low supply when someone is battling depression, explains David Muzina, MD, the founding director of the Cleveland Clinic Center for Mood Disorders Treatment and Research.

Boost your strength, boost your happiness? A recent study of 45 stroke survivors with depression found that a 10-week strength training program helped reduced symptoms of depression (among numerous other benefits).

Strength training is about mastery and control, says Leslie Seppinni, PhD, a clinical psychologist and family therapist in Beverly Hills. It requires full attention and concentration. More importantly, people can see the results, the outline of the muscles forming, from dedication and training.

Just be sure to start slowly and use the assistance of a personal trainer if needed.

<h1>Agression</h1>
<span>Anger is a natural and healthy reaction to frustrating situations. However, you shouldn't let anger take over because it does add significantly to stress levels. Angry outbursts can cause health issues like migraines, headaches, weak immunes systems and even increase the risk of heart attacks. Anger is not just an emotional reaction but a physical reaction as well. Your jawline tightens, muscles stiffen and maybe you grit your teeth as well. When you exercise, it helps shift your focus to the physical aspect and burns off excess energy. Research has supported the idea of exercising to reduce anger as well as stress.

<h3>boxing</h3>
<span>
Grab some boxing gloves and head to the gym to vent your anger on a punching bag. Take a boxing class or kickboxing class to divert your anger and release the stress you're holding on to. Symbolically, you would be able to work out your anger by taking it out on the punching bag instead of a real person. The exercise is not just a stress reliever but a great way to stay in shape as it is a high-intensity workout.

<span>Yoga is an exercise that purifies your mind, body, and soul. This spiritual approach to anger will help you clear your mind and, depending on the level of yoga, give you quite an intense workout. Stretch out the body, increase flexibility and focus on your breathing-the anger will just wash away. Specifically, the virabhadrasana (or the warrior pose) in yoga is a powerful stance that helps to release pent up anger and sadness. The pose focuses on balance and instilling courage.

<h3>Deep-breathing</h3>

<span>
Deep breathing exercises can help the body relax. You may not think of deep breathing as an exercise but it is a useful trick to keep your mind at ease-especially when you feel your anger rising. The best thing to do is take yourself out of that situation, step away to a quiet place so you can gather your thoughts and refocus. Sit in a comfortable position (or lie down if you have the accommodations for it) place one hand on your stomach, close your eyes and inhale focusing on the air entering your lungs. Pause a second before exhaling slowly. Focus on breathing, clear your thoughts and calm the muscles
